## Abstract
The objective of this project is to develop an online multimedia database system - MeTube,
similar to Youtube. The MeTube allows users to share, manage multimedia files through a web
interface. Moreover, interactions among users are enabled. Through the course of CPSC
4620/6620: Database Management Systems, we have integrated new theory and techniques
along with the development of the MeTube project.
Overall, the MeTube project has implemented five parts including:

1) User account;
2) Data sharing;
3) Media organization;
4) User interaction;
5) Search.

Detailed database & relation schema, basic & advanced functions implemented under each
major part, and testing cases will be shown in the following sections.
